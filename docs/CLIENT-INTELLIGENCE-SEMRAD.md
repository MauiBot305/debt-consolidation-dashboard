## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### **If Considering Partnership:**

**1. Primary Contact:** **Patrick Semrad** (51% owner, active attorney, no known license issues)
- Avoid lead role for Robert (license suspended)
- Patrick is managing partner, decision-maker

**2. Due Diligence Required:**
- ✅ Verify Robert's **current license status** (Illinois ARDC)
- ✅ Review **Chapter 11 exit plan** and creditor obligations
- ✅ Assess **reputational risk** from 2023 media coverage
- ✅ Audit **software security** (HIPAA/SOC 2 readiness)
- ✅ Verify **Bulgaria operations** (ZenTeli compliance)

**3. Scope Partnership Carefully:**
- **Software licensing** (StratusBK, Talkt) — safe path
- **Consulting/advisory** (expertise only) — manageable risk
- **Co-ownership/equity stake** — HIGH RISK (bankruptcy, legal issues)
- **Client referrals** — verify compliance first

**4. Protect Against:**
- Reputational blowback from PPP controversy
- Compliance violations (HIPAA, data security)
- Financial obligations from DebtStoppers bankruptcy
- Robert's inability to practice law (if his role is critical)

**What to Ask:**

1. **Robert's license status** — when/if reinstatement planned?
2. **DebtStoppers bankruptcy exit** — all creditor obligations met?

**What to Offer (If Interested):**

1. **Debt consolidation expertise** — your business model

**Bottom Line:**  
The Semrad brothers built a **$10M-$50M bankruptcy empire** with **100,000+ clients** and **proprietary software**, but it **collapsed in 2023** due to financial mismanagement, PPP loan controversy, and Robert's license suspension. **Patrick Semrad** (51% owner, active attorney) is the safer contact. **Proceed with extreme caution** — high risk, but real tech/expertise value if compliance gaps are addressed.
