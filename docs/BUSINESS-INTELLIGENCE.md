### Analysis: Does $1.2M/Year Match Reality?

**DebtStoppers Payment:** $1.2M/year  
**Our Estimate:** $1.4M/year  
**Variance:** -$200K (-14%)

#### Conclusion: ✅ **PAYMENT ALIGNS WITH COSTS**

**Why the discrepancy?**
1. **Volume discount:** DebtStoppers may pay below full cost if ZenTeli serves other clients
2. **Family subsidy:** Semrad brothers may subsidize operations (Patrick/Robert/Joe co-own)
3. **Lower actual headcount:** 47 may include part-time or contractors
4. **Conservative estimate:** Our salary ranges are mid-market; ZenTeli may pay slightly less

**Verdict:** $1.2M is reasonable for a 47-person Bulgarian operation providing paralegals, call center, and dev support.

## JOB 3: FILL IN THE GAPS

### What Patrick Missed: Critical Debt Consolidation Requirements

#### 1. **Regulatory Requirements by State**

**What It Is:**  
Debt management companies must comply with state-specific licensing, bonding, and registration requirements. Requirements vary significantly:
- **Bonding:** Surety bond amounts range from $25K (AZ) to $100K+ (CA, NY)
- **Licensing:** Some states require debt management company license (e.g., CA, FL, TX)
- **Registration:** Many states require annual registration + renewal fees
- **Exemptions:** Some states exempt non-profit credit counseling agencies

**Why It Matters:**  
- Operating without proper licensing = **criminal offense** in many states
- Clients in non-licensed states = **unenforceable contracts**
- State AG enforcement actions common (see: debt relief industry crackdowns 2010-2015)

**Regulatory Requirement:**  
- **Federal:** FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule (advance fee ban)
- **State:** 30+ states have debt management service acts
