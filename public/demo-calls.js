      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'I\'m sorry to hear that. I\'m here to help. Can you tell me a bit about your situation? How much debt are you dealing with?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'It\'s about $85,000 across five cards. The minimum payments are killing me. I can barely pay my rent.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'That sounds incredibly stressful. You\'re definitely not alone - we help people with this every day. Are the accounts still current, or have any gone past due?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Two are past due by about 30 days. I\'m scared they\'re going to send me to collections.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'I understand your concern. The good news is we can absolutely help. Our program negotiates with creditors to reduce your total debt, often by 40-60%. You\'d make one affordable monthly payment instead of five.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Really? How does that work exactly?' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'We set up a dedicated savings account for you. Instead of paying creditors directly, you deposit a fixed monthly amount. Once enough accumulates, we negotiate settlements. Most clients are debt-free in 24-48 months.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'What about fees? I\'ve heard some companies charge upfront.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'We never charge upfront fees. Our fee is only collected after we successfully settle a debt. It\'s included in your monthly payment - typically 15-20% of enrolled debt.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Okay, that sounds fair. Can I enroll today? I really want to get started.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'Absolutely! I\'m glad you\'re ready. I\'ll need to gather some information and send you the enrollment documents. Can we start with your full name and email?' },

      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'I completely understand your caution, Patricia. It\'s smart to ask questions. What concerns do you have?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Well, first - how much does this actually cost? The last company wanted thousands upfront.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'We never charge upfront fees. Our fee is a percentage of the debt we successfully settle - typically 15-20%. You only pay after we get results. No settlement, no fee.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Okay, that\'s better. But how long does this take? I have about $42,000 in debt - credit cards, some medical bills, and a personal loan.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'Mixed debt like that typically takes 24-36 months. The timeline depends on how much you can comfortably afford monthly. What are your minimum payments right now?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Around $1,400 a month. It\'s more than half my income.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'That\'s unsustainable. In our program, we\'d look at a payment around $700-850 monthly. Does that sound more manageable?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Definitely. But will this hurt my credit?' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'Your credit may be impacted initially since you\'ll stop direct payments to creditors. However, settling debts and becoming debt-free will help long-term. Plus, carrying $42K at high interest is already hurting you financially.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'True. What about lawsuits? Can creditors sue me?' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'It\'s possible but uncommon. We work with creditors to prevent that. If a lawsuit were filed, we partner with attorneys to handle it at no extra cost to you.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'I need to think about this. Can you send me something in writing?' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'Absolutely. I\'ll email you a detailed program overview and our fee structure. Would you like me to follow up in a few days?' },

      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Hi Mike, my friend Jessica Rodriguez said I should call you. She just finished your program.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'Oh, Jessica! Yes, she was a wonderful client. Graduated debt-free last month. How can I help you?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'She said you helped her settle $45,000 for like half. I have similar debt and I\'m struggling.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'I\'d be happy to help you the same way. Jessica was in a tough spot when she started, but she stayed committed and it paid off. Can you tell me about your situation?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'I have about $52,000 across three cards and a personal loan. I make $4,200 a month but the minimums are $1,300. I\'m drowning.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'That\'s a debt-to-income ratio over 100% - you\'re exactly the kind of person we can help. With $52K, you\'d likely see settlements around $26,000-31,000 total.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Jessica mentioned something about stopping payments to creditors? That scares me.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'I understand the fear, but here\'s why it works: Right now, $1,300 disappears monthly and your balances barely move. In our program, that same money goes into your settlement fund. Your creditors would rather get 50% in a lump sum than watch you struggle forever.' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'That makes sense. Jessica seemed so relieved at the end.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'She really was. And she referred you, which tells me she trusts us. Referrals are the biggest compliment we get. Would you like me to walk you through what enrollment would look like?' },
      { speaker: 'caller', text: 'Yes, please. I\'m ready to hear more.' },
      { speaker: 'agent', text: 'Great! First, let me get some basic info and send you the program details. Then we can schedule a follow-up to answer any questions. Sound good?' }
